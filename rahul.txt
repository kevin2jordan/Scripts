Abstract. Cloud computing is emerging trend of next generation technology due to its versatility. Cloud-based services are provided through the internet and internet is most vulnerable to various types of attack. These attacks add various risks relating to numerous security and privacy concerns. Especially group collaborative applications have much significance in the projects relating to group. This paper proposes a generic framework which supports secure data sharing among multiple groups of people communicating each other respecting predefined policy. The proposed framework fits closely into the real world scenarios where multiple groups exist in a hierarchical manner, for example in organizations or institutes. To this aim, we improve TGDH key management approach aiming at reducing both the time and space complexity. We design a tree-based group key management for inter-and intra-group data sharing which provides a scalable solution by maintaining a metadata about various groups. Unlike existing techniques, our framework supports key distribution without involving any semi-trusted third party, yielding a more robust multi-group secure data sharing scenario.
